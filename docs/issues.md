# Possible issues
- Since I'm allowing passwordless authentication, the server may be vulnerable
  - but if they have access to the server they could just
    - `docker ps`
    - `docker exec -it -u 0 docker_container bash`
  - so it may not matter so long as I don't expose the port to the firewall
    - perhaps I should use a very unique port since 2222 seems patternish
- Multiple ssh connections to the same host using the same user
- I need to ssh into the original server
  - then I need to ssh into the proxy-tunnel server
    - from there I can forward my port
  - It seems as though I can pass a sock as an option
    - This may mean I can use the original sock to do my next business
  - for now it's just local so I only need to connect to 127.0.0.1:2222
- Two tunneled people may use the same port
  - Luckily [I can use `0` as a port](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2/blob/master/lib/client.js#L1253)
  - From there, the port *should* not be taken in the proxy-tunnel-server
